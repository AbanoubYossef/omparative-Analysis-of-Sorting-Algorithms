# Sorting Algorithms Comparative Analysis

This project consists of several Python scripts that perform a comparative analysis of different sorting algorithms. It covers a range of sorting algorithms, including Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort (iterative and recursive). The goal is to assess their performance under various scenarios and input sizes.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following scripts:

1. `quick_sort_vs_heap_sort.py`: Compares the Quick Sort and Heap Sort algorithms, including their performance in best-case, random, and worst-case scenarios.

2. `randomized_quick_sort.py`: Implements the Randomized Quick Sort algorithm and sorts a list of elements using a randomized pivot selection strategy.

3. `iterative_vs_recursive_bubble_sort.py`: Compares the iterative and recursive implementations of the Bubble Sort algorithm. It measures and compares the total number of operations and runtime for sorting random lists of different sizes using both variants of the algorithm.

## Getting Started

To run these scripts, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can run each script individually to observe and analyze the performance of the sorting algorithms.

Example:

```bash
python quick_sort_vs_heap_sort.py
```

## Usage

- The `quick_sort_vs_heap_sort.py` script provides a comparative analysis of Quick Sort and Heap Sort, including visualization of the results using Matplotlib.

- The `randomized_quick_sort.py` script demonstrates the Randomized Quick Sort algorithm and sorts a list using this strategy.

- The `iterative_vs_recursive_bubble_sort.py` script compares the iterative and recursive Bubble Sort implementations and visualizes the results.
